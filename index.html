 <p2>The decrease in the number of people affected by hunger has happened in a period where the world population has increased by 2.2 billion - from 5,3 billion in 1990 to 7.5 billion in 2018. The share of undernourished people in the world has therefore fallen markedly in the past three decades. From 19% in 1990 to 10.8% in 2018.</p2>
 <p>Of the 822 million undernourished people in the world, 113 million face acute hunger meaning they are in urgent need of food and nutrients</p>

<li> Food waste ends up wasting a quarter of our water supply in the form of uneaten food. That’s equated to USD$172billion in wasted water.</li>
<li> The water used to produce the food wasted could be used by 9 billion people at around 200 litres per person per day.</li>

Food loss primarily occurs in restaurants and households as Chinese culture sees hosts order more food rather than less to show hospitality to their guests.</li><a href="https://www.ifad.org/en/web/latest/-/blog/fighting-food-waste-in-china-local-efforts-global-effects">FOOD WASTAGE IN CHINA</a>

 SO WHAT CAN YOU DO NOW ?
</h1>
</center>
<p>
 World hunger is a pressing issue that affects millions of people around the globe. The statistics on food wastage in India and other countries are alarming, and there is a need for concerted efforts to address the problem. It is crucial to raise awareness about the issue and take action at various levels, including households, businesses, and governments. We can all play a part in reducing food waste by adopting sustainable practices such as buying only what we need, donating excess food to those in need, and supporting initiatives that promote food security. By working together, we can make a difference in fighting world hunger and building a more equitable and sustainable world for all.
</p>
<p>
We all celebrate our birthdays,Marriage days and many more events. We request you to donate 0.1% of food.
With this we may not eliminate  world hunger in a day, but we can achive this  one day.
